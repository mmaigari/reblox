                            <p class="the-first-major justify">A real estate deal in the Swiss city of Baar, featuring 18 flats at Grabenstrasse 3 and a restaurant named "Hello World," was tokenized for approximately $3.2 million USD. The total token value of 3 million CHF, roughly $3.2 million USD, equates to 20% of the property's total value. Four investors acquired all tokens in a club sale through four separate transactions on the Ethereum network. This transaction functioned as a Security Token Offering, representing property ownership under Swiss law, despite not being linked to a company.</p>

Valued at €6.5 million, the luxury building in Boulogne-Billancourt was purchased by French real estate firms, Sapeb Immobilier and Valorcim.</p>
                            <p class="investors-can-choose">The process involved transferring ownership to a joint-stock company (SAPEB AnnA) and dividing it into 100 tokens, each subdivided into 100,000 units and traded for €6.50 each. This Ethereum-powered tokenized sale is part of global efforts to integrate real estate transactions with blockchain technology.</p>
